My name is Adam Van Antwerp and I love the web.  I'm here to help us all communicate
with each other in a human, intuitive, and productive way.  I can write in Javascript
and Python, I enjoy working at all levels of the stack, and I am passionate about sharing
any tiny bit of knowledge I obtain with others. I consider myself a lifetime learner and
it is for this reason that I have chosen to pursue web development and programming in general.

### Personal Details

Outside of web development, I enjoy coffee, dance music, sailing, cooking, zymurgy and water
skiing.  I come from Reno, NV and though I have lived in Portland for quite some time I will
always call the Sierras Nevadas home.  I currently attend Hack Reactor through their online
remote program, however I plan to relocatate to San Francsico, CA upon completion of the
program.
